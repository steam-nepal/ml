    "**Text:**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Projectiles are objects that move through the air or space under the \n",
    "influence of gravity. We've all seen projectiles in action - from a \n",
    "baseball soaring through the air to a rocket blasting off into space. In \n",
    "this lesson, we'll explore the basics of projectile motion and how it \n",
    "applies to our daily lives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Projectile Motion?\n",
    "\n",
    "Projectile motion is the study of objects that move under the influence of\n",
    "gravity. It's a fundamental concept in physics that helps us understand \n",
    "many natural phenomena, from the flight of birds to the trajectory of \n",
    "bullets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Five Key Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "To fully grasp projectile motion, we need to consider five key factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Velocity**: The speed at which an object starts moving.\n",
    "2. **Angle of Projection**: The angle at which an object is thrown or \n",
    "launched.\n",
    "3. **Gravity**: The force that pulls objects towards the ground.\n",
    "4. **Time**: How long it takes for the projectile to reach its maximum \n",
    "height.\n",
    "5. **Range**: The distance traveled by the projectile from launch to \n",
    "impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Equations of Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've covered the basics, let's dive into some equations! These \n",
    "will help us predict where projectiles land and how high they fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Initial Velocity (v0)**: v0 = √(2\\*h/g) where h is the initial height \n",
    "and g is the acceleration due to gravity.\n",
    "* **Range (R)**: R = (v0^2 \\* sin(2θ)) / g where θ is the angle of \n",
    "projection.\n",
    "* **Maximum Height (h_max)**: h_max = (v0^2 \\* sin^2(θ)) / (2\\*g)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quizzes and Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's your turn to practice what you've learned! Try solving these \n",
    "quizzes and problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A baseball is thrown at an angle of 45° with an initial velocity of 90 \n",
    "km/h. How far does it travel?\n",
    "\t* Answer: R = (90^2 \\* sin(90)) / 9.8 ≈ 123.5 meters\n",
    "2. A bullet is fired from a gun at an angle of 30° with an initial \n",
    "velocity of 250 m/s. What's its maximum height?\n",
    "\t* Answer: h_max = (250^2 \\* sin^2(30)) / (2\\*9.8) ≈ 43.5 meters\n",

    "\n",
    "And that's it! You now have a solid understanding of projectile motion and\n",
    "how to apply it to real-world scenarios. Remember, the next time you watch\n",
